            <h2 id="blockchain-voting">Blockchain-Based Voting System</h2>
            <p>
                This project explores the use of blockchain technology to create a secure,
                transparent, and tamper-resistant voting system. The system is designed to
                ensure voter anonymity while maintaining verifiable election results through
                immutable blockchain records.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each vote is recorded as a transaction, preventing duplication or manipulation.
                The project focuses on understanding decentralization, consensus mechanisms,
                and trustless verification.
            </p>

                This project was developed as part of my <strong>Class 12 final-year project</strong>,
                with the goal of studying how blockchain can be applied beyond cryptocurrencies,
                particularly in governance and democratic processes.

            <h2 id="clipdash">ClipDash – Automated Content Clipping Platform</h2>
            <p>
                ClipDash is an automation-focused project designed to extract, process, and
                distribute short-form content from long videos or livestreams. The system
                analyzes timestamps, detects relevant segments, and prepares clips suitable
                for platforms like YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project was developed for a <strong>client</strong> and helped me gain
                practical experience in workflow automation, API integration, and media
                processing pipelines.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                ClipDash emphasizes efficiency and scalability, demonstrating how repetitive
                creative tasks can be optimized using software-driven systems rather than
                manual editing.
