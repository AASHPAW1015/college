                <h2>About the Album</h2>
                <p><strong>The Dark Side of the Moon</strong> is the eighth studio album by the English rock band
                    <strong>Pink Floyd</strong>, released on March 1, 1973. It was primarily developed during live
                    performances, with the band premiering an early version of the record several months before
                    recording began.
                </p>
                <p>The album explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness, drawing
                    inspiration from the band's own stressful lifestyle and the mental health struggles of former member
                    Syd Barrett.</p>

                <h3>A Lasting Legacy</h3>
                <p>The album is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. It is
                    one of the best-selling records in history, with estimated sales of over 45 million copies
                    worldwide. It sat on the Billboard 200 charts for a record-breaking 741 weeks (over 14 years) from

                <p>Its iconic cover art, designed by Storm Thorgerson, depicts a prism dispersing light into color and
                    represents the band's stage lighting, the record's lyrical themes, and keyboardist Richard Wright's
                    request for a "simple and bold" design.</p>
